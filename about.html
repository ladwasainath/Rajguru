            <h1>Rajguru Pen Mart (RPM)</h1>
            <p>Established in 1992, Rajguru Pen Mart (RPM) was born from a simple vision — to make quality stationery accessible to everyone. What began as a modest venture has today grown into a trusted name, connecting renowned brands with customers across cities, towns, and villages throughout India.</p>

            <p>For over three decades, RPM has been the silent partner in countless classrooms, offices, and creative corners. We proudly bridge the gap between leading manufacturers and everyday users, ensuring that every product — from pens to paints — carries our hallmark of quality, reliability, and care.</p>

            <p>Our collection features top brands like Flair, Apsara, Nataraj, Hauser, and Reynolds, and many more, reflecting our commitment to offering the best at every level.</p>

            <p>While we’ve grown with time, our core belief remains unchanged:</p>
            <blockquote>“To deliver the best, with honesty and heart.”</blockquote>
